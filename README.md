# Activity-Period

Overview:

The Activity Period project consists of developing an application that consists of various users and their respective activity periods.

The project consists of a management command which adds the dummy data of users and their activity periods.

-> To add dummy data for user we read a csv file which is located in the project folder itself data.csv.
-> I have created a GET Api for fetching users and their activity periods.

for running the management command we will run the following command: 
   python manage.py populatedata users

For setting up the porject we will follow the below steps:
- git clone the repository link https://github.com/AnanyaSharma22/Activity-Period.git
- create virtual environment 
- To install requirments run: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the project locally with the command: python manage.py runserver
